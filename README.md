# Problem Solving in C++

This repository contains my daily practice and solutions to various programming problems using **C++**. The problems cover a wide range of topics and data structures, from basic to advanced levels.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash Maps, etc.
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.
- Competitive Programming Questions from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, and more.

## ðŸ“… Updates

I update this repository on a **daily basis** as part of my learning and continuous improvement in problem-solving.

## âœ… Goals

- Strengthen algorithmic thinking and coding skills
- Master core C++ concepts and STL
- Maintain a personal reference for revision and future use

## ðŸ’¡ Note

This repository is open for learning and sharing. Feel free to explore or use the code for educational purposes.
